# Efficiency-at-Misson-Control-Using-Functions
Overview
In your last Mission Control assignment (Mission Control, We Have Blastoff!), you copied and pasted code 10 times.  Priority 1 for the UAT Space Program is quality and efficiency. 

The UAT Space program demands the best practices in code for efficiency so you are tasked to make improvements to the code. This means you will need to add a loop instead of repeating the code. 

Use the Module 1 Assignment for reference for this assignment, then implement the loops
